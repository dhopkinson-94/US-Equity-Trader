# US-Equity-Trader

Currently in development not operational!

This repo is a trading bot written in Python with wrapper for Alpaca markets API. This is a public copy of my private repo running my strategy. I am currently adapting it 
so anyone can fork it and easily run their own strategy.

Add your own strategy to the Strategy script. Currently the script will only operate simple buy-sell strategies. This may change with future verions.

The Main script can be scheduled to run through git workflows and API keys passed through git secrets.
