# US-Equity-Trader
This repo is a trading bot written in Python with wrapper for Alpaca markets API. This is a public copy of my private repo running my strategy. I am currently adapting it 
so anyone can fork it and easily run their own strategy.

Add your own strategy to the Strategy script.

The Main script is run via git workflows and API keys passed through git secrets.
